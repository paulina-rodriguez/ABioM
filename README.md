# Agile for Biomedical Modeling (ABioM)

Agile for Biomedical modeling (ABioM) is a framework for translational science applications that supports the entire process of model development, adaptability, transparency, credibility building, testing and quality assurance, and applicability to the context of use. ABioM manages all modeling project lifecycle efforts including model development, bench-top experiments, and credibility building. For more details regarding the methodology see ABiom: An Agile Framework for developing Credible Biomedical Models (Link)

## ABioM Tools
This Repository includes helpful tools and template for implementing ABioM that complement the methodology in the paper: 

* Applicability Analysis Plan
* Applicability Analysis Tables
* Ranking of Confidence and Knowledge of Interactions (or phenomena) Table (ROCKIT) 

Additionally, Trello Board templates were created for managing the project modeling lifecycle and the credibility efforts: 
* [ABioM Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/nWsNt41M/abiom-template)
* [Credibility Goals Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/OfRiqlqk/credibility-factors-template)

Note: For your personal use please copy the Trello board template. Also, we would appreciate your constructive feedback or ideas on the current cards(i.e. gradations) by using the comment feature on the board.
